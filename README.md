## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🏠[1. House Price Prediction] | Machine Learning Project

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Developed a regression-based machine learning model to predict house prices using key features such as area, number of rooms, and location.
Performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering to extract insights and improve model performance.
Implemented and compared models like Linear Regression, DecisionTree,SVM, achieving an R² score of XX% on the test dataset.
Visualized predicted vs. actual prices using Matplotlib and Seaborn for performance evaluation.

Highlights:

Preprocessed data using scaling and encoding techniques.

Performed outlier detection using Z-score (>3 threshold).
Outliers were either removed or capped to prevent them from skewing model performance.

Designed a clean, modular workflow for reproducibility.

### 👥 [3. Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)]

Unsupervised learning project to segment customers based on spending habits and income levels.

**Tech Used:** Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
**Highlights:** Clustering, silhouette score, visualization of customer groups

### Wind Speed Forecasting Using LSTM (Multivariate Time Series)

I developed a multivariate LSTM model to forecast wind speed using historical wind dataset features such as wind direction, humidity, and temperature. The project includes full data preprocessing, normalization, sequence window generation, time-series model building, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation using RMSE. I also implemented SHAP explainability to identify how each feature influences the model's predictions. The project follows structured deep-learning workflows and is fully automated for training, forecasting, and visualization.
