## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🏠[1. House Price Prediction] | Machine Learning Project

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Developed a regression-based machine learning model to predict house prices using key features such as area, number of rooms, and location.
Performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering to extract insights and improve model performance.
Implemented and compared models like Linear Regression, DecisionTree,SVM, achieving an R² score of XX% on the test dataset.
Visualized predicted vs. actual prices using Matplotlib and Seaborn for performance evaluation.

Highlights:

Preprocessed data using scaling and encoding techniques.

Optimized model parameters with GridSearchCV

Designed a clean, modular workflow for reproducibility.
